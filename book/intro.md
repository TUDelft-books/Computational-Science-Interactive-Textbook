# Welcome to the Computational Science interactive book

This book was created as a lecture material for TN2513 Computational Science at Delft University of Technology. However, it is open to everyone who wants to learn how to use programming to solve problems in physics. We will walk you through most important numerical techniques you will need as a phycists and teach you how to deploy them for your day-to-day physics challenges. Read 'About this book' for detailed overview of the content, pre-requisities and instructions on how to use this book.
