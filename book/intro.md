# About the course
In this course, you will learn to solve problems in physics using computational tools by programming these problems into a computer.

## Why are programming and computational tools important in physics?
One reason is that while many of the (toy) problems you will encounter in your undergraduate program have analytical solutions (since they are chosen carefully by the teachers of your course), most problems encountered in physics will in general not have an analytical answer, and so if you really need to know the solutions of these non-simplified problems, you will have to calculate them numerically.

Another useful reason is that computational solutions to problems can often provide quick insight into complex equations without too much work: once you know how to program the numerical solution, you can use your computer to do numerical "experiments", playing with parameters to explore what happens.

And finally, programming itself has become an essential toolbox for the physicist: from programming the control and acquisition of data in experiments; to the processing, plotting, and analysis of data from experiments; to plotting and analysing theoretically derived formulas, to numerical computations for simulating complex problems in physics; and the list goes on. A high proficiency in programming is now considered an essential skill in physics, and is one that is also highly valuable for careers outside of physics.

## Python
The programming language we will use in the course is python, one of the most popular programming languages right now, an one which in recent years has come to dominate the physical sciences, particularly among data scientists. It has become popular because of its flexibility and simple syntax. Although it is slower than some of the traditional low-level languages like C or Fortran, this has become less of an issue for many problems as computers have gotten faster, and for heavier numerical calculations, it can easily interface to libraries that run highly optimized code pre-compiled in low-level languages.

## Jupyter Notebooks
Jupyter notebooks are a way of interacting with the python programming language that have become very popular in recent years with data scientists. Juptyer notebooks, as you will see, are a way to combine the code you provide to python, the output it produces (like graphs), and notes and documentation text (like the one you are reading now), all in one place. This makes them very powerful for documenting and interacting with code, along with interpreting what results.

This same feature makes them very useful for teaching, as we can combine both the conceptual learning material with code and exercises all in one document, which will will do extensively throughout the course.

# What you can expect to learn
On a high level, our goal is that after this course you are able to simulate problems in physics using Python. The topics we will cover are:

Week 1:
* Review of [Introduction to Python for Physicists](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/python-for-applied-physics/practicum-lecture-notes) (TN1405 material)
* Numerical Differentiation
* Numerical Integration
Week 2: 
* Root finding
* Linear algebra
Week 3: 
* Practice Assignment
* Fourier transforms 1
Week 4: 
* Fourier transforms 2
* Practice midterm
Week 5: 
* Random numbers
* Ordinary Differential Equations 1
Week 6: 
* Ordinary Differential Equations 2
* Practice Assignment
Week 7: 
* Partial Differential Equations 1
* Partial Differential Equations 2
Week 8:
* Practice Exam
* Review and catch-up

In week 1, we include some review material (the same lecture notebooks as in Inleidend practicum TN1405), but now with some autograded exercises inline so you can test your knowledge of the material (no assignments).

Note that the indication of the weeks is only a guideline and determines a nominal schedule of the lecture. If the review material is familiar to you, we strongly encourage you to move through the material at a pace faster than we indicate above. You should also ensure that you move through the lecture material at a pace sufficient to complete first half of the course before the midterm.

For each of the lectures, there are also lecture-specific learning objectives that should give you a clear idea of what you are expected to be able to do. The collection of all of these can be found on the course page on Brightspace.
