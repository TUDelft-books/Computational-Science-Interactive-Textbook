Python is an interpreted language, which means adding anything to a hand-coded loop is just a really, really bad idea if you don't have to. Because `np.max()` does the calculation with \"vectorized\": it runs with pre-compiled, and not interpreted, loops.

    "Although we did not gain much speed with the Gauss-Seidel technique, there is a small trick we can play with it to make it MASSIVELY faster.\n",

    "The trick is as follows: instead of correcting `phi` to the value that would solve the equation based on it's neighboring values, we go *a bit* further: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\phi_{new}(x,y) = \\phi_{old}(x,y) + \\omega \\delta\n",

    "where $\\delta$ is the correction that you would have calculated in the Gauss-Seidel method and $\\omega$ is a number between 0 and 2. With $\\omega > 1$, this technique is known as successive over-relaxation (SOR). It turns out, if you pick the right $\\omega$, you simulation can run MUCH MUCH faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "Picking the optimal value of $\\omega$ is not easy, and depends in detail on the size and even configuration of your simulation. The Gauss-Seidel method corresponds to $\\omega = 1$. For $\\omega > 2$, the method does not converge (it is unstable). And, for nonlinear Poisson equations (in which $\\rho$ depends on $\\phi$ in a nonlinear way, which I studied in my PhD), under-relaxing with $\\omega < 1$ can help unstable simulations converge. In general, for regular linear PDEs and large simulations, a value close to 2 is a good guess, and guessing a bit high is better than guessing to low. But even if you guess a bit wrong, it still can speed up your simulation very significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "(In particular, it can change the scaling with simulation size from $N^2$ to $N^{1.5}$, which is a huge deal! You can read chapter 5 of my <a href=http://nsweb.tn.tudelft.nl/~gsteele/thesis/Gary_Steele.compressed_images.pdf>PhD thesis</a> if you would like to learn some more about the speed and applications of relaxation technique.)\n",
