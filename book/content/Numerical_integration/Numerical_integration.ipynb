    "## Numerical Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Often in physics, we will want to calculate the integral of a function, which can be interpreted at the area under the curve of the function between a starting point and and ending point, as illustrated here:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](integral.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike taking a derivative, calculating the analytical form of a derivative is not always easy, and is not even guaranteed to have an analytical closed form! This is one of the reasons it is useful to calculate integrals numerically, know as Numerical Integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discretisation\n",
    "\n",
    "As is the case for any calculation in a computer, the first step is to break our continuous variable $x$ into list of numbers `x[i]` separated by (typically) fixed steps (know as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretization>discretising</a>), along with corresponding set of $y$ values $y[i]$:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](discrete.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will name the spacing between the steps in $\\Delta x = h$. The example above would correspond to a total number of points $n = 4$, and following the python convention of counting from zero, the last point is then `y[3]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "From there, we can use several different approximations to calculate the integrated area, a few of which we will describe here. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple sum\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest is to simply sum up all the `y[i]` values except the last and then multiply this by the spacing $h$. For a total number of points $n$, this results in an estimate of the integral $I_{sum}$ given by: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I_{\\rm sum} = h \\sum_{i=0}^{n-2} y_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is equivalent to the following area graphically as an approximation of the continuous integral: \n",
    "\n",
    "![image](simple_sum.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the sum limit in the formula above **does not** include the last point ($i = n-1$), but instead stops at second-to-last point ($i=n-2$). This is because for $n$ points, there are $n-1$ blocks (\"slices\") between the first and the last points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trapezoidal rule\n",
    "\n",
    "An obvious improvement over the sum rule above is to replace the \"flat tops\" of the boxes above with sloped lines that connect one point to the next:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](trapezoid_rule.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as the Trapezoidal rule: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule\n",
    "\n",
    "We can already see that this is giving a much better approximation! The formula for the estimated integral using the trapezoidal rule is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I_{\\rm trap} =  h \\left( \\frac{y_0 + y_{n-1}}{2} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n-2} y_i \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula is in fact nearly identical to the simple sum, except that instead of using the first point and skipping the last point, we replace the first point with average of the first and last points. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Simpson's rule\n",
    "\n",
    "While the trapezoidal rule is clearly much better, we can do even better if we use a quadratic interpolation instead of a linear interpolation between the points. This technique is known as Simpson's rule: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_rule\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the estimate of the integral is given by a more complicated sum involving different coefficients for the odd and even points:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I_{\\rm simp} = \\frac{h}{3}\\left( y_0 + 2\\sum_{i=1}^{(n-1)/2-1}y_{2i} + 4\\sum_{i=1}^{(n-1)/2}y_{2i-1} + y_{n-1} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the exercises below, you will explore implementing these different types of numerical intergration techniques in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises \n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by calculating the following integral: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_0^2 (x^4 - 2x +1) dx\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "using two different techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "This integral is actually one that you can calculate yourself and has the exact value of 4.4. This will be handy as we can use this exact value to compare with the values that our numerical calculations give. \n",
    "\n",
    "(The idea, of course though, is that numerical integration is useful for calculating the integrals of functions that are not easy to calculate! But we will do this later, and for now, it is handy to know what the answer is.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, it is useful already to make a plot of the function we are integrating. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we will create an array x ranging from 0 to 2 with 100 points (just to get a bit of a smooth plot). We will then create second array y which will be our integrand, and then we will plot y versus x.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 1:** Modify the code below to produce a plot of the integrand in the range of 0 to 2 with 100 points.\n"

    "## Benchmarking the Trapezoidal Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you will often be using your code to calculate an integral for which you do not know the answer. However, in this case, since we do know the answer, you can get a feeling for how accurate your code is by comparing your calculated value to the correct answer. \n",

    "This sort of \"benchmarking\" is an integral part of developing numerical simulation software. In particular, you can always find a way for your code to give you \"an answer\". But how can you trust that it is the correct answer? How do you know how much influence the approximations you have made have on the calculated result? \n",
    "\n",
    "For this, it is always a good idea to use your code to perform a calculation for a case where you know the answer. This will allow you to play around to see how to optimize your code to be more accurate (and also to find bugs!). Of course, getting an accurate answer for one type of calculation does not guarantee that your code will be accurate for all calculations, but by trying it out for different types of calculations, you can start to get a feeling for how it performs and build up some trust that it will give you an accurate answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will explore such a \"benchmarking\" of the Trapezoidal rule for calculating integrals, and explore the number of steps needed to achieve a given accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 3:** Use a `while` loop to find the minimum value of $N$ you need to get the correct answer to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_error#Formal_Definition>relative error</a> of less than $10^{-6}$ = one part per million (ppm).\n",
