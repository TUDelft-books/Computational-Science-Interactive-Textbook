A computer can only run  deterministic algorithms, hence any number generated by a computer is not truly random. A computer generates pseudorandom numbers that for the majority of problems are sufficiently random. \n",

Starting with an initial number $x_0$, $a$, $b$, and $m$ the equation makes new numbers that are seemingly random (for the proper choice of $a$, $b$ and $m$) but follow the same sequence. The number $x_0$ is called the seed, and when calling the random number generator with a fixed seed the random numbers are always the same. When you call the random function in Python the algorithm picks a seed from a random sequence stored in the computer. Therefore you get a different random number every time you call `rand()`.   \n",
    "\n",
    "To set the seed for the computer you can use the function `seed()` from the numpy random library with in between the `()` a fixed number variable. The number is of no importance, only that is an integer. Seeding can be handy for debugging and to compare your code to the code of somebody else. So in the exercises in this note we set the seed to 0 to get answers that can be quantitatively checked. Try it out for yourself."
