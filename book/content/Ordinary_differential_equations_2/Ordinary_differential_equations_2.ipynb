    "## Boundary value problems and the shooting method\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, we have been finding the solutions of differential equations given a particular initial condition: for example, for a second order differential equation, we have been specifying the initial velocity and initial position.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some times where you want to constrain your solution of the differential equation not by the initial conditions, but by a combination of the initial condition and the final condition. An example of this is for a second order ODE: instead of finding the solution corresponding to a given initial position $x_i$ and initial velocity $v_i$, one might want to find a solution that has a given initial position $x_i$ and a given final position $x_f$. This is an example of a boundary value problem: we are constrained by the values of the function on the boundaries, not by the initial velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does one approach such a problem? \n",
    "\n",
    "One method for solving this is a technique known as the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_method>shooting method</a>. In the shooting method, one makes a guess at an initial velocity $v_i$ and then calculates the final position $x_f$. If you do not get it right in the first guess, you keep redoing the calculation with different $v_i$, using a technique such as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm>binary search</a> to find the initial velocity $v_i$ that gives the desired $x_f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "_(The inspiration for the name of this technique comes from how one would hit a target with a cannon: a simple way is to take a trial shot, see where it lands, and then adjust the angle up and down until you get it right; or at least close enough to hit your enemy!)_\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we consider the following problem: I am going to throw a ball straight upwards in the air, and I want the ball to land back down at the same spot in exactly 10 seconds. What velocity do I need to give the ball? \n",
    "\n",
    "Neglecting air resistance, this problem is easy to solve (you can solve it with high school physics!). Once we add air resistance to the problem (which we will at the end of this notebook), the problem becomes very difficult to solve analytically, which is where numerical methods become very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have learned already how to perform RK4 numerical integration of differential equations, and earlier in the course, we have also learned how to find zeros of a function efficiently using binary search. With the skills you have learned, you could easily write code to perform the shooting method directly yourself (and you may be asked to in the exam!). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, here, we will explore how to implement the shooting method using some more advanced features of the <a href=https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html>solve_ivp()</a> routine of the `scipy` library. To do this, we will make use of the optional parameter `events` of the `solve_ivp()` routine. This is a special way to tell `solve_ivp()` to detect conditions on the integration it is performing and stop the integration when that condition is satisfied. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way `events=` parameter works is that you need define a function that gets passed your variables `y` and `t` and which should return a number. When your \"event\" function undergoes a zero crossing, then you can have `solve_ivp()` stop the integration automatically. You can also configure if this zero crossing is a \"rising\" or a \"falling\" edge trigger (see the assignment from week 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "How do I use this `events` parameter in practice? The `events` parameter needs to take a <a href=https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html>object</a> (or a list of objects in case you want to track many events).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wait a minute: what the heck is an \"object\"?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are an advanced feature of Python. In fact, most of the things you have been working with are already objects, even though you didn't notice it! Objects are special variables that can \"contain\" stuff: they can contain, for example, both functions that can perform operations and data that stores values.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example you have already seen is numpy arrays. For example, consider the following numpy array:"

    "Cool! But how do I make my own \"object\"? It sounds scary! In most languages, it requires some more detailed of knowledge of the language to do so... However, python has some great shortcuts that makes building your own objects very easily, on the fly, using a technique in python with a funny name called \"<a href=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/monkey-patching-in-python-dynamic-behavior/>monkey patching</a>\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You can construct the \"object\" that the `solve_ivp()` parameter `events=` requires by first creating a function that does what you need and then turn it into an \"object\" by adding some fields with the correct names. To be concrete, for our example of throwing a ball vertically in the air, we will want to stop the numerical integration once the height of the ball falls back down to zero. For this, I will need an event function that returns the height of the ball. If I choose my `y` variable array such that `y[0]` is the vertical position `x` and `y[1]` is the vertical velocity `v`, then my function would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def myevent(t,y):\n",
    "    return y[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you give it this function, the `solve_ivp()` routine will work to find the precise integration conditions and trigger the event such that the value that your function `myevent()` returns the value zero. In this case, because we are looking for the condition that the height of the ball is zero, then life is very easy: we just return the height of the ball! If we instead wanted to trigger the event when the height of the ball is 1, then we would replace the last line of our function with `return y[0]-1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For `solve_ivp()`, I then need to make it an object by adding two extra fields. One field is called `terminal`, which tells `solve_ivp()` if should stop when this event is triggered, or if it should keep on going. As we are done once the ball hits the ground, we can make our event terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "myevent.terminal = True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Magico! Now `myevent` is no longer just a function that can do stuff, but an object that contains a field that stores some information! In addition, we need to add another field to our `myevent` object that tells `solve_ivp()` if it should look for a \"rising edge zero crossing\" (direction = 1) or a \"falling edge zero crossing\" (direction = -1). We want the latter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "myevent.direction = -1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When finished, the `sol` object that `solve_ivp()` returns will contain a field `t_events` that is a list of all the times that an event occurred at: for us, this list will contain one entry, corresponding to the time at which the ball came back to the place we threw it from.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, it becomes very easy to implement the shooting method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We define an \"event\" function that returns the value of the height of the ball\n",
    "2. We make a guess of an lower and upper limit on the velocity in between which we think the correct initial velocity can be found\n",
    "3. We use binary search to iterate through initial velocities until we find one that gives us a total time of 10 seconds for the ball fall back down (within a given accuracy). \n",
    "\n",
    "One problem with this technique is that we need to get some reasonable values for the initial guesses. For this, it is handy to run the numerical integration a few times with different values of initial velocity to see what range we should choose for our binary search.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 2(a):** Consider a ball with mass $m = 0.1$ kg thrown upwards into the air with an initial velocity of 1 m/s. Use `solve_ivp()` to calculate how long it takes for the ball to reach the ground again. Assume that the $g = 9.81$ m/s$^2$. For the numerical integration, you need to pick a time endpoint that will be longer than the time it will take for the ball to come back down. A time limit of 100 seconds should probably be fine."
